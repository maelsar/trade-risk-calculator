# Trade Position Size Calculator
## OVERVIEW:
I created this tool to help me compute for my Crypto future positions.
I wanted a clean and simple calculator without the distracting ads.

This was for personal use but I intend to share it with  other who wants to use it as well.

This calculator does not consider how much margin you have left.  
WARNING: Do not over expose yourself!

## Design:
Everything was made with vanilla Javascript and CSS.
Computation is done on client side in the browser with Javascript.

If your interested in the source code, check it out on my github.


### Good luck on your trades and may the trend be with you!
